# teaching-board
This web app is designed to help teachers create whiteboard videos with virtual backgrounds on their webcam. It includes image annotation capabilities, allowing teachers to draw on the images or add text for demonstrations and teachings. The app provides an intuitive interface for teachers to experiment with different combinations of data sources and backgrounds, making it easy to tailor the whiteboard videos to their needs.
